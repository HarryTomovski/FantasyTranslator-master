    <string name="information" >Many days have I fought in order to finish this application. But alas, my work has come to an end. This app has been developed for the android spring semester 2020
        project, it serves as proof that the student has acquired knowledge in regards to the topics discussed during class. Many translation apps are out there but not one can
        translate Orlando Bloom, ahh I meant sindarin. What\'s more this app can translate pretty much any fantasy language there is. While there is still a lot to improve, especially
        when it comes to the user interface, the application\'s main functionality works as planned.
